# Implementation notes

Hello there. I've done most of point in task lisk expecp for Character page
due to insufficient time. And also I've decided to use sass over styled-components
because it's more flexible and convinient for me.
We could've been use redux and hell of a support libraries but this would be a
complete overkill.

It's a simple CRA so `yarn && yarn start` to enjoy.

Looking forward to work with you and have a nice day!

Sincerely yours,
Paulo
